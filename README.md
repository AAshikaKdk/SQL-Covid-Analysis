# SQL-Covid-Analysis
Covid Cases and Vaccinations Analysis



**Project Summary:**
Explore Covid Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations with the help of SQL.
At the start of 2020, a novel disease known as COVID-19 instilled fear in all of us, resulting in the loss of numerous cherished individuals. It was a challenging period for people worldwide, as we encountered an unprecedented lifestyle that surpassed our wildest imaginations. I finally got chance and skillsets to analyze many interesting insights about Covid during the onset and how it gradually evolved.



**Skills Used: **
- SQL to manipulate and analyze data




**Desired Insights:**
- What was the total Cases Vs Total Deaths?
- How was Nepal handling the situation (Nepal, being a small country, faces challenges with its medical and economic infrastructure, which are relatively underdeveloped and lagging   behind. I am from Nepal so I wanted to know how was the situation there compared to others)
- What was the total number of COVID cases detected within the entire population?
- Which countries experienced the highest infection rate per population?
- Which Continents had the highest death rate?
- What was the ratio of Vaccination vs population in different countries?
- What was the percentage of people vaccinated?
